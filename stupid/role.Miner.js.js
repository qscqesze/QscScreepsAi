/*
 * ROLE: MINER
 *
 * A miner harvests energy from a source and drops it where it sits. 
 * It remains in a fixed position, except to move into position after spawning.
 * The goal of a miner is to extract all energy available from a source in the most 
 * efficient way possible.
 *
 * To capture all energy from a source, you need to average 10 units per tick. WORK 
 * harvests at 2 units per tick, so I need about 5 work body parts on a source. 
 * Because of time lost by moving into place, I should round up to 6.
 * The body composition of a miner is fixed so a single individual can extract all energy 
 * from a source before it resets.
 *
 * A miner's seat value specifies the exact position it should sit at.
 *

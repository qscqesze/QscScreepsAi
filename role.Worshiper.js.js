/*
 * ROLE: WORSHIPER
 *
 * A worshiper takes energy from storage or a container and uses it to upgrade the room's 
 * controller.
 * A worshiper should ideally be sedentary so it does not have to move between energy 
 * pickup and dropoff, thus upgrading the controller continuously every tick.
 *
 * WORK == Upgrades a controller for 1 energy unit per tick.
